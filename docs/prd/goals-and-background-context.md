# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver a unified translation and review interface that eliminates the fragmented workflow of using separate tools for translation and editing
- Enable side-by-side comparison of original and translated text with synchronized scrolling for efficient review
- Provide in-place editing capabilities so users can edit translations directly without export/import cycles
- Support progress saving and resumable translation for longform documents
- Create a simple, document-focused workflow optimized for individual users and small teams translating standalone documents
- Establish product-market fit with individual academics, researchers, and writers through MVP validation
- Differentiate from free tools (no review workflow) and enterprise platforms (too complex/expensive) by targeting the underserved individual/SMB segment

## Background Context

Librilabs Translator addresses a significant gap in the translation software market. Current tools either lack review capabilities (free tools like Google Translate, DeepL) or are too complex and expensive for individual users (enterprise platforms like Smartling). This leaves a $500M-$1B serviceable addressable market underserved.

**The Problem:** Users translating longform documents (research papers, academic articles, business reports, books, blog posts) face a fragmented, inefficient workflow requiring multiple tools and manual processes:

1. **Translation Step:** Users upload documents to translation tools (DeepL, Google Translate) or use APIs
2. **Export Step:** Download translated text (often losing formatting or structure)
3. **Review Step:** Open translated text in a separate editor (Word, Google Docs, text editor)
4. **Comparison Step:** Manually compare original and translated versions (switching between windows/tabs)
5. **Editing Step:** Make corrections and refinements in the editor
6. **Re-import Step:** Copy/paste or re-upload if changes needed in translation tool

**Impact:** This fragmented workflow adds 30-50% overhead to translation time, introduces errors through manual copying/pasting, breaks workflow continuity, and forces users to either accept lower quality from raw machine translation or pay $500-2,000 per document for professional services.

**The Solution:** Librilabs Translator combines AI-powered translation quality with an integrated human review workflow, specifically designed for longform document translation. The MVP focuses on TXT file translation with side-by-side comparison, in-place editing, and progress saving—validating the core value proposition before expanding to additional file formats.

**Target Market:** Individual academics and researchers (primary), professional writers and content creators (secondary), and small business teams (tertiary) in English-speaking markets. This represents 4-8 million individuals and 780K-1.95M small businesses with regular document translation needs.
