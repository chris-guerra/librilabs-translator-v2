# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Librilabs Translator, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

N/A - Greenfield project

The project is being built from scratch as a monorepo with:
- `frontend/` - Next.js 16.0.4 application (already initialized)
- `backend/` - FastAPI application (to be created)
- `docs/` - Documentation directory

No starter templates or existing codebases are being used. The architecture will be designed specifically for the translation workflow requirements outlined in the PRD.
