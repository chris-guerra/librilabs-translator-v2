  - Makefile supports development mode with volume mounting for hot-reload
  - Docker images use intuitive names (librilabs-translator-backend, librilabs-translator-frontend)
  - Environment variables are properly configured
  - All services can start and communicate correctly
  - Development workflow is documented
