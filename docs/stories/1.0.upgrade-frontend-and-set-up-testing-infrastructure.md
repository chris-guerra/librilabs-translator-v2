# Story 1.0: Upgrade Frontend and Set Up Testing Infrastructure

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** the frontend upgraded to the required versions and testing infrastructure configured,  
**so that** I can develop with the correct tech stack and have testing capabilities from the start.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Frontend Next.js is upgraded from 14.2.5 to 16.0.4
2. React is upgraded from 18.3.1 to 19 (as required by Next.js 16.0.4)
3. All frontend dependencies are updated and compatible with new versions
4. Frontend application runs successfully after upgrade
5. Frontend testing framework (Vitest) is installed and configured
6. React Testing Library is installed and configured for component testing
7. Playwright is installed and configured for E2E testing
8. Basic test setup files are created (vitest.config.ts, playwright.config.ts)
9. Example test files demonstrate testing patterns for frontend components
10. Frontend test scripts are added to package.json (test, test:e2e)
11. Backend testing framework (Pytest) setup is documented in backend setup guide
12. Backend testing with httpx is configured (will be implemented in Story 1.1)
13. Testing infrastructure is verified to work (can run example tests successfully)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist. This is the first story in Epic 1.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Frontend Framework:**
- Next.js 16.0.4 (currently 14.2.5 - upgrade required)
- React 19 (currently 18.3.1 - upgrade required)
- TypeScript (Latest stable)

**Frontend Testing Stack:**
- Vitest (Latest) - Unit/integration testing
- React Testing Library (Latest) - Component testing
- Playwright (Latest) - E2E testing

**Backend Testing Stack:**
- Pytest (Latest) - Unit/integration testing
- httpx (Latest) - API testing

**Note:** Current frontend package.json shows Next.js 14.2.5 and React 18.3.1. The frontend must be upgraded to Next.js 16.0.4 and React 19 to match the tech stack.

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Frontend Test Organization:**
```
frontend/tests/
├── unit/
│   └── components/
├── integration/
│   └── api/
└── e2e/
    └── workflows/
```

**Backend Test Organization:**
```
backend/tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_services/
│   └── test_models/
└── integration/
    └── test_routers/
```

**File Locations:**
- Frontend package.json: `frontend/package.json`
- Vitest config: `frontend/vitest.config.ts`
- Playwright config: `frontend/playwright.config.ts`
- Example unit test: `frontend/tests/unit/components/Example.test.tsx`
- Example E2E test: `frontend/tests/e2e/example.spec.ts`
- Backend setup docs: `backend/README.md`

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Frontend Component Test Pattern:**
```typescript
// frontend/tests/unit/components/DocumentUpload.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import { DocumentUpload } from '@/components/document/DocumentUpload';

describe('DocumentUpload', () => {
  it('validates file format', () => {
    render(<DocumentUpload onUploadSuccess={vi.fn()} />);
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

**E2E Test Pattern:**
```typescript
// tests/e2e/translation-workflow.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('complete translation workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  // Upload document
  // Start translation
  // Wait for completion
  // Verify side-by-side view
  // Edit translation
  // Download
});
```

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests: `frontend/tests/unit/`
- Integration tests: `frontend/tests/integration/`
- E2E tests: `frontend/tests/e2e/`

**Testing Framework Configuration:**
- Vitest: Fast unit testing for React components, Vite-based for speed
- React Testing Library: Testing utilities for React components, works with Vitest
- Playwright: End-to-end testing for critical user workflows

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Follow naming conventions: Components use PascalCase
- Environment variables: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefix for frontend
- Error handling: Proper error boundaries and error states

**Naming Conventions:**
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
- Test files: `.test.tsx` or `.spec.ts` extension

### Frontend Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Component Organization:**
- Components in `frontend/components/`
- UI components from Untitled UI library (not yet installed, will be in later stories)
- Custom hooks in `frontend/lib/hooks/`
- Types in `frontend/types/`

**State Management:**
- TanStack Query for server state (not yet installed, will be in later stories)
- React useState/useReducer for local state
- Zustand optional for complex UI state

**Path Aliases:**
- `@/` maps to `frontend/` directory (configured in tsconfig.json)
- Use `@/components`, `@/lib`, `@/types` in imports

### Technical Constraints

**Next.js 16.0.4 Upgrade Considerations:**
- React 19 is required by Next.js 16.0.4
- Check for breaking changes between Next.js 14.2.5 and 16.0.4
- Verify App Router compatibility (current structure uses App Router)
- Check TypeScript compatibility with new versions

**Testing Configuration Requirements:**
- Vitest needs jsdom environment for React component testing
- Playwright requires browser binaries (installed via `npx playwright install`)
- Test files should follow naming convention: `*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.ts`

**Dependency Compatibility:**
- Ensure all dev dependencies are compatible with Next.js 16.0.4 and React 19
- Update TypeScript types packages to match React 19
- Verify no peer dependency conflicts

### Testing

**Test File Location:**
- Frontend unit tests: `frontend/tests/unit/`
- Frontend E2E tests: `frontend/tests/e2e/`
- Backend tests: `backend/tests/` (documentation only in this story)

**Test Standards:**
- Use Vitest for unit/integration tests
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Use Playwright for E2E tests
- Follow testing pyramid: More unit tests, fewer E2E tests

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Vitest: Fast, Vite-based test runner
- React Testing Library: Component testing utilities
- Playwright: Browser automation for E2E testing
- Pytest: Python testing framework (documentation only)
- httpx: Async HTTP client for API testing (documentation only)

**Example Test Patterns:**
- Component tests should use React Testing Library render and screen queries
- E2E tests should use Playwright page object and assertions
- Tests should be isolated and not depend on external services

**Test Scripts:**
- `npm run test` - Run Vitest unit tests
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run Playwright E2E tests
- Backend test commands documented but not implemented in this story
